## copies what it needs rather than growing a shared dependency — because it encodes the one
## thing that cost this family a day: [b]Godot refuses an RPC unless both ends declare the
## same set of `@rpc` methods[/b], and routes it by the receiver's NODE PATH. Using the same
## script on both ends makes the set identical by construction; naming the node the same on
## both ends and parenting it to a node that is itself named the same ([DotServer] on one
## side and [DotClientLink] on the other, both called `Server`) is the whole of the routing.

##   Wipeout         <- this, on both
