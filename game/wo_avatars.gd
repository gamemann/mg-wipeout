## What a player looks like, as a dot-user-avatar document: the schema, the stock avatar a
## player without one of their own wears, and which skin a document asks for.
##
## [b]One slot, because this game's people differ in one thing.[/b] Every Blocky Character
## carries byte-identical geometry and UVs, so the six people [WoFigure] can draw are six
## atlases on one mesh — and the side a player is on goes on the torso as a tint, which is
## the game's to decide and not the player's. A document with a hat slot in it would be a
## promise this game has no art to keep.
##
## [b]Data only, and loads nothing.[/b] A dedicated server validates a document against
## this schema without holding the art, which is dot-user-avatar's whole premise; which
## atlas a skin means is [WoFigure]'s, on a client. [constant SKINS] and
## [code]WoFigure.ATLASES[/code] are the same list in the same order, and `headless_run`
## checks that they stay so.
##
## [b]The stock avatar is the old hash, exactly.[/b] Before this file a player's look came
## from `hash(player_id)` into the atlas list; [method stock_avatar] makes the same choice
## into a document, so nobody's character changed the day profiles arrived, and a server
## with no platform draws everybody precisely as it did before.
