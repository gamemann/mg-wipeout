## [b]dot-menu's `DotMenuSettings` with this game's schema[/b] (2026-10-09). It was a 250-line
## copy of mg-buses-from-hell's file — a manager, a `match` over four keys and a bare settings
## screen — and the same copy was in five other games. What is left here is what is this
## game's: where the document lives, and the stock keys it has nothing to apply to.
##
## [b]The scopes are the family's, not this game's.[/b] `sensitivity` is ACCOUNT under the
## shared `tmc_account` namespace — a person's hand, the same number in every game here.
## `field_of_view` is SERVER_CLAMPED: a wide view is an advantage a server may cap, and
## dot-settings gives a server no way to READ it. The volumes are this machine's.
