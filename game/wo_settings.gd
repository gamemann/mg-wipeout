## [b]mg-buses-from-hell's `WoSettings`, renamed[/b] (2026-10-08), because mg-wipeout had
## the three things that read a setting — a sampler, a camera and dot-audio's mixer — and no
## screen to change any of them: Escape let go of the mouse and offered nothing to click.
## The reasoning is that file's, and it is kept here because it is still true:
##
## [b]`apply_all()` on load, and it is the line this family keeps losing.[/b] A value read
## from disk has not CHANGED, so a game that applies settings only from `changed` ignores
## every saved one until the player touches it — their saved sensitivity does nothing, and
## the slider shows the number they chose. Every value is pushed once after load and once
## whenever something new binds, then `changed` keeps them current.
##
## [b]The scopes are the family's, not this game's.[/b] `sensitivity` is ACCOUNT under the
## shared `tmc_account` namespace — a person's hand, the same number in every game here, so
## it is converted the way every other game converts it ([constant DEGREES_PER_COUNT]).
## `field_of_view` is SERVER_CLAMPED: a wide view is an advantage a server may cap, and
## dot-settings gives a server no way to READ it. The volumes are this machine's.
